# DCGAN-Cifar10

This is a example realization of DCGAN, and train the model on [cifar10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), results are shown in the following:

### Run
Modify the `DCGAN.py` file , enable `train()` function to train DCGAN model, enable `gen_samples()` function to generate learned samples. The `gen_samples` function needs to load the trained model, which was so big that I can not upload it! So you need to train it first! Sorry for that--
